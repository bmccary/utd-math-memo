# What is This?

A template I use to create memos and recommendations.
The result looks [like this](https://bmccary.github.io/utd-math-memo/memo.pdf).
The signature is from the [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) Wikipedia article and is public domain.

# Usage

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/bmccary/utd-math-memo.git
```

The directory `utd-math-memo` will be created. Possibly move it to a new name, but anyhow change to that directory.

```
mv utd-math-memo recommendation-letter-for-einstein-albert
cd recommendation-letter-for-einstein-albert
```

Edit `memo.tex` and then

```
make
```

You'll want to replace the `signature.png` file with your own.
