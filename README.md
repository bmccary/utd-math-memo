# What is This?

A template I use to create memos and recommendations.
The result looks [like this](https://github.com/bmccary/utd-math-memo/raw/master/memo.pdf).

# Usage

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/bmccary/utd-math-memo.git
```

The directory `utd-math-memo` will be created. Possibly move it to a new name, but anyhow change to that directory.

```
mv utd-math-memo recommendation-letter-for-einstein-albert
cd recommendation-letter-for-einstein-albert
```

Edit `memo.tex` and then

```
make
```
